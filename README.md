# Computational Screening of Metal-Organic Frameworks for Helium Recovery 


Using data-driven chemistry to target Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) capable of separating helium from other gases (Nitrogen and Methane) through adsorption.

The work was split into two areas of research.


## Weronika and Adam

Weronika and Adam focused on MOF pre-selection and Henry's coefficients' calculations to determine the best-performing structures for the selective nitrogen/methane adsorption.

## Jude and Salom√©

Jude and Salome investigated cost, sustainability and stability of MOFs, to find the ones that were the most sustainable (non-toxic, non-radioactive, had a low supply risk), the cheapest (based on elemental cost of the MOFs) and the most stable (based on average coordination number).
